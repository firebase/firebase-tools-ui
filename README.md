# Firebase Tools UI

The web UI for Firebase Emulator Suite. Features include:

- Overview of Emulators running
- Firebase Realtime Database Data Viewer/Editor
- Cloud Firestore Data Viewer/Editor
- Logs Viewer with powerful filters

## Development

### Start the Development Server

To run the development server with test data:

```bash
firebase emulators:exec --project sample --only database,firestore --import test-data 'npm start'
```

This will run the web app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

NOTE: The `emulators:exec` command is necessary to set the environment variables for the web app to talk to emulators.

### Developing within a user project

You can also start the dev server of GUI and connect to your real project. To do so, first start the emulator suite in your project folder:

```bash
cd project/
firebase emulators:start --import my-data

âœ”  hub: emulator hub started at http://localhost:4400
```

This will run the emulators for your project.<br />

In another terminal, run the Emulator Suite UI from the firebase-tools-ui folder: (note that `<project-id>` must be replaced with the matching project id of your project.)

```
cd firebase-tools-ui/
GCLOUD_PROJECT=<project-id> FIREBASE_EMULATOR_HUB=localhost:4400 npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Other Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production, both server and web.

The web production build will be output to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

The server code will be packed into `server.bundle.js`, which is a standalone
JS file including all dependencies, ready for execution with Node.js.

To run the production build with emulators, use:

```bash
firebase emulators:exec --project sample --only database,firestore --import test-data 'PORT=3000 node server.bundle.js'
```

This will start a server that serves both the static files and APIs at `http://localhost:3000/`.

NOTE: The static files are not meant to be deployed to a website or CDN. They must be used in conjunction with
the server as described above.
