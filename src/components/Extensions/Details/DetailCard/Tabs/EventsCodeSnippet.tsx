   ### Create Custom Event Handlers
   
   This extension publishes events to the \`${
     extension.eventarcChannel
   }\` channel. You can create custom handlers that respond to events on this channel. For example:
   
     import { onCustomEventPublished } from "firebase-functions/v2/eventarc";
 
     export const eventhandler = onCustomEventPublished(
       "${extension.allowedEventTypes ? extension.allowedEventTypes[0] : ''}",
       (e) => {
           // Handle extension event here.
       });
     `;

  return null;
